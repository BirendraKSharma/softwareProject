# Hospital Management System (HMS) â€“ Python Flask Project

## Overview

This project is a **Hospital Management System (HMS)** built using Python and Flask. The application is designed to manage information related to healthcare, supporting healthcare providers in efficiently handling various aspects of hospital management.

It demonstrates integration with ReplAuth for authentication and showcases how to access and display user information from Replit headers in a Flask web app.

## Authentication with ReplAuth (Python Flask)

**Example code to fetch user data from headers:**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
app = Flask('app')

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    print(request.headers)
    return render_template(
        'index.html',
        user_id=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Id'],
        user_name=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Name'],
        user_roles=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Roles'],
        user_bio=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Bio'],
        user_profile_image=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Profile-Image'],
        user_teams=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Teams'],
        user_url=request.headers['X-Replit-User-Url']
    )
```

**Available Replit Headers:**
```
X-Replit-User-Bio
X-Replit-User-Id
X-Replit-User-Name
X-Replit-User-Profile-Image
X-Replit-User-Roles
X-Replit-User-Teams
X-Replit-User-Url
```

Display a username in a template:
```html
<h1>{{ user_name }}</h1>
```
